<h1>cat-adoption</h1>
This is a Django application that simulates a cat adoption hub. Users can view the cats available for adoption and submit requests to adopt specific cats. Solo final project for BIT2008: Multimedia Data Management. Note- this is a copy of my original submission to Carleton-BIT's Github classroom, I could not obtain personal access to the original.

<h2>How It Works:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Cats are stored in a database and added using the Django admin tool</li>
<li>Users can create an account and fill out an adoption profile that will store all of their relevant information to be used whenever they make a request to adopt</li>
<li>Each cat has its own adopt button which allows the user to make an adoption request</li>
<li>All of a user's existing adoption requests can be viewed in one convenient place</li>
</ul>
